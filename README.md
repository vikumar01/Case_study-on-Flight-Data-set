# OpenJaw T-Data Data Science Interview Case Study 

Congratulations on making it to the next stage of the interview process. This section is a case study involving openly available airline departure and arrivals data, along with associated weather data. The high-level aim of the case study is to evaluate how you go about solving data problems that are like the ones that you will be solving as a data scientist at OpenJaw. 

## Case Study 

Disruptions have a significant negative impact on airlines, airports and the passenger experience. Design an analytic solution to predict flight disruptions and cancellations using the provided data. The addition of other external datasets you feel are relevant is permitted. 

### What we would like to see 

1) Fork this repository to your personal GitHub/GitLab account and use version control throughout the process. 

2) Perform exploratory analysis of the data 

3) Build a machine learning model(s) that can predict delayed and cancelled flights. 

4) Make a short report on your findings including visualisations and ideas on how to improve the customer experience from the model(s) you've created. 

5) Give a 3-5-minute oral presentations to us on your work, followed by 15-20 minutes of questions from us on it. 

We recommend that you spend between **4-6 hours** on this challenge, anymore isn't necessary. Python is the preferred programming language for this case study, but R is also acceptable. The presentation can be in any form, i.e. PowerPoint, PDF, Word, Markdown, Latex or Whiteboard. 

### Prior to interview

Can you send on a link to the GitHub repo where the work was done, including any presentation material a few hours before the interview (please make sure that we can view the repo). This is needed so we can setup the room and have your presentation ready. 

This case study is left open-ended on purpose to give you freedom to solve the problem as you deem appropiate.
